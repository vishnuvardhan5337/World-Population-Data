 🌍 World Population Data Analysis 📊  

This project explores "global population data" using "geospatial analysis" and "data visualization" techniques. The goal is to analyze "population density" across different countries and continents while presenting insights through visual representations.  

 🔍 Key Objectives:  
✔️ Analyze "population growth trends" over different years.  
✔️ Identify "top 10 most & least densely populated** countries.  
✔️ Visualize "continent-wise population density" using box plots.  
✔️ Create an "interactive choropleth map" to highlight global population distribution.  

 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used:  
📌 "Pandas" – Data manipulation and analysis.  
📌 "Matplotlib & Seaborn" – Data visualization with bar plots and box plots.  
📌 "GeoPandas" – Geospatial data handling.  
📌 "Plotly" – Interactive world map visualization.  

 📌 Key Insights & Findings:  
📍 Countries with "highest population density" are mostly small island nations or urbanized regions.  
📍 "Least densely populated countries" tend to have vast land areas with extreme climates.  
📍 The "interactive world map" provides an intuitive way to explore population patterns across countries.  

🚀 This project demonstrates how "data science and geospatial analysis" can provide valuable insights into global population trends!
